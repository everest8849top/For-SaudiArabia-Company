1. Question: What's the main objective of our project?
Answer: To build an AI chat application using OpenAI ChatGPT APIs that interacts with user-owned deeds through REST API.
2. Question: How do we integrate OpenAI ChatGPT into the application?
Answer: By making HTTP requests to OpenAI servers, sending user input as prompts, and processing model-generated responses.
3. Question: What's in the sample Excel file for testing?
Answer: It contains example conversations, user queries, and deeds data for application testing and training.
4. Question: How does the app interact with user-owned deeds via REST API?
Answer: It uses REST API calls to perform specified actions on user-owned deeds based on parsed user input.
5. Question: How is user data security maintained?
Answer: Security measures include encryption, authentication, access controls, and ensuring proper privacy of user-owned deeds data.
6. Question: How does user authentication work in the app?
Answer: Users are authenticated through secure mechanisms like username/password or token-based authentication.
7. Question: How does the app handle multi-turn conversations?
Answer: It maintains context from previous interactions, using user input history to provide coherent and contextually relevant responses.
8. Question: What error handling is in place for API interactions?
Answer: Robust error handling for API calls ensures smooth user experience with appropriate error messages.
9. Question: How does the app adapt to diverse user queries?
Answer: Natural language processing techniques are used for understanding and interpreting a wide range of user queries.
10. Question: What tools and technologies are used for development and deployment?
Answer: Python, web development frameworks, Docker for containerization, and cloud services for scalability and availability.
